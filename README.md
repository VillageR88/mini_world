# Mini World

A simple turn-based simulation written in Java.  
Players have bases, produce units periodically, move them on a grid, and engage in battles.

## Features

- 10x10 grid simulation
- Bases that produce units periodically
- Unit movement and combat logic
- Quit anytime

## Requirements

- Java 22+ (or any compatible version)
- Gradle (wrapper included)

## Build

Use the Gradle wrapper to build the project:

- **Windows:**

```bash
.\gradlew.bat build
```

- **Linux/macOS:**

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Run

After building, run the application using:

- **Windows:**

```bash
.\gradlew.bat run
```

- **Linux/macOS:**

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Future Development

- Improvements to game mechanics
- Implementing AI-driven unit behavior

## Notes

While AI is a valuable tool in the learning process, the entire code of this project is purely handwritten using traditional coding practices — no “vibe coding” or auto-generated solutions.
